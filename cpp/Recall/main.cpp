The Goal: Create a program that acts like a bouncer at a club, but also checks for senior discounts.
Requirements:
Ask the user for their age.
IF the age is less than 18:
Print: "You are too young to enter."
ELSE IF the age is greater than 65:
Print: "Welcome! You qualify for a senior discount."
ELSE (for everyone else, aged 18 to 65):
Print: "Welcome to the club."



int age {};

std::cout << "What is your age" << std::endl;
std::cin  >> age ;

if (age < 18) {
    std::cout << "You are too young to enter" << std::endl;
}
else if (age > 65){
    std::cout << "Welcome! You qualify for a senior discount" << std::endl;
}
else {
    std::cout << "Welcome to the club" << std::endl;
}
